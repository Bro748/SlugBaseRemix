# Welcome to the SlugBase API docs!
These are intended to help mod authors implement custom features.

Slugcat and world features can be accessed through [SlugBase.Features.PlayerFeatures](SlugBase.Features.yml#SlugBase_Features_PlayerFeatures) and [SlugBase.Features.GameFeatures](SlugBase.Features.yml#SlugBase_Features_GameFeatures), respectively.
